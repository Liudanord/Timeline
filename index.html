            <h4 class="timeline-title">Year When I Decided I Would Never Become an Artist</h4>
            <div class="timeline-text">
              <p>   I was 9 and I entered local art school,  since I always liked to draw, for the first time I was very excited with the  school lessons. But after several months my enthusiasm disappeared.
              There was 60 years date of the ww2 victory in that year. And we all had to draw only about war,  as well technics and materials always were the same. Nothing has changed day by day. It lasted for 6 months, I was only 9 and I was tired of it very soon, I wanted doing something different, wanted to experiment, wanted to create cool stuff. But all I was given, were war, death and acrylic paint.</p> 
              <p> There was time of student’s exhibition, and I was too bored with all those absolutely similar pictures my classmates drew. However was already rebellious, I wanted to go different, and decided do something that will shock. And I did. I drew the a1 picture with the angel flying over the city, but the Angel was in SS soldier uniform.</p> 
              
                <p> My plan had worked my Nazi-Angel was a bomb! My teacher was shocked and mad about it, to be honest. Of course they did not take my picture to the exhibition, and very soon I was kicked out from the art school.
              In two words 2005 was the year I decided never to draw again.</p>

            <h4 class="timeline-title">  In a Name of Rock`n`Roll </h4>
            <div class="timeline-text"><p>Music always was and still is the great source of inspiration for me.  When I think about my teenage years there are 3 things coming to my mind:  vintage cassette player, leather jacket and rock `n` roll. </p>
            <p>And Rock music was the thing that pushed me back to the Idea I want to draw again, I want to create something. It started from self-made t-shirts with stencil pictures, hand-drawn posters and portraits of my favourite musicians. </p>
            <p>Firstly, I start doing it because of a lot of fans did, for fun for likes in social media and in the name of rock `n` roll of course. But very soon I found out that I like it. I spent my free time for drawing lessons and challenges, watching YouTube workshops and even did my first steps to web design,  the field in which I am working now, when I worked on the design of my personal blog where I posted stuff I  had created. But still, I did not think about art as a profession, or field of future study, I never thought art will ever bring me money</p>

            <div class="timeline-text">
              <p>When I was 15 my world turned upside down when I watched LA ink tv show and realised that I want to be a tattoo artist. I saved pocket money for several month to buy a tattoo machine and when my parents saw that I am more than serious about this thing they helped me and pay for tattoo courses. </p>
              
              <p>I spent 3 months in tattoo studio called” Zznak”  working on sketches,  studying tattoo techniques on artificial leather and watching how tattoo-artists do their job. The first tattoo I made on real human was 15 x 15 cm linework black and white picture of Harley Davidson motorcycle engine, and my first client was my father. After I had finished course I started working as  tattoo artist, firstly I made cheap tattoos for friends and classmates but  when I become absolutely confident about my skills I started  promote myself in social media and trying to find new clients. </p>

            <h4 class="timeline-title">How I pay nothing for Euro Trip and Got My First Design Experience</h4>
            <div class="timeline-text">
              <p>Despite of the fact that I already worked in the creative field, and all the advises from my friends and family, I decided that I will not study art in university. I chose math and physics classes in high school and was kind of good in it. I am not sure I even liked it but I was obsessed with the idea of study and later work in the field which is “not for woman”. I was always surrounded mostly  by men  since my young age, I think  I always was  a tomboy. And it was incredibly important for me to prove everyone and  what is more important  myself  that I am not worse  because I am a girl. For this reason in 2015 I finished my first course in MADI studying mechanical Engineering, being one of 3 girls among 250 boys we studied with. And despite of the fact that in one year after it I leave MADI, this university gave me one really great experience. In my first days in uni I joined the university team constructing the electrical motorcycle for international competition.  </p>
              <p>I ride motorcycle since the age of 16 and weight not much, and it was enough to become a team pilot. As well I took part in the process of constructing and design of our bike, and what was more important in creating team identity starting from pages in social media and finishing with flyers booklets, team t-shirts and stickers we need for the competition. All this was huge different but as I think now very important experience, which in the end of all made me leave the university and radically change the field of study. </p> 
              <p>But before it being the part of the team I took part in the international competition in Spain where we even took some place and as well had one of the most interesting trips in my life when on the way back from Spain our team  visited 5 countries, met a lot of amazing people and just spent a great time together, and the best part was that university paid for everything. </p>

            <div class="timeline-text">
              <p>After one and half year I decided to leave MADI I saw no future for myself as engineer and understood that this is even not interesting for me. It was a little sad to live our team and to miss the opportunity to take part in the next competition, but I was absolutely sure that my life needed some changes. The next year I spent working and thinking where to go next, I had no certain plan. </p>
              <p>But I proceed drawing and working as tattoo artist and as well by that time I was a member of motorcycle club for about a year. So, in 2016 together with my clubmate we started a leather workshop. We produced different leather goods such as pockets document cowers, bags motorcycle accessorises and a lot of other things. I did the design of products, managed social media, produced visual content for them and do a  lot of work connected initially with the process of creating the product. I really loved what we did and in one year was sure I need to start my education again but now I the creative field. </p>

            <div class="timeline-text">
              <p>I started my Pre-Foundation course with not very clear understanding which direction I wanna go in future. The whole Idea to go to BSHAD was very spontaneous and I tried not to run ahead and just tried all this new thing opened in front of me. The course was mostly about skills and by the end of the year the only thing which become clear to me was the fact that I want to proceed my education here. But the next year gave me probably the most memorable and reach educating experience. One of the most memorable training projects for me was my final project of the foundation course - the design of the mobile application interface for moto travellers. </p>
              <p>For me, this project is especially important because it helped me derive my basic working rule "I can do everything, and if not, give me Google and a couple of hours and I will learn" And what is also important this year gave me strong confidence that I am truly interested to proceed my study as graphic designer. </p>

            <div class="timeline-text">
              <p>This year I first time start worked as graphic designer.  As all beginners I took all possible freelance works I could found. My first serious client was Chelyabinsk circus called “Earl Orlov”. And I had one night to redesign tickets for their show. In The original ticket they send me with a comment “fix it a little” there were used 13 different fonts and background photo contained watermarks. In two words original files consist of all the stamps from jokes about bad design. Circus guys liked my work and later contacted me 3 or 4 times. As well they helped me to find a constant client –  the printshop, with which l later worked for several months. to be honest it was the least interesting job of my life (by the way, I once worked as a warehouse supervisor, and even that was better).  I literally drown in the monotonous work of no value.  But nevertheless, this experience gave me the necessary knowledge of prepress and developed incredible level of stress resistance. </p>

            <div class="timeline-text">
              <p>I entered the first BA year when all my classmates had already happily graduated. But It was for the first time in my life when I was confident about the plans for the nearest future.  Studying demanded great return from me and this taught me planning – thing from which I always ran away, relying on chance or luck.  Experience with the printing house had shown that I was not very interested in design of printed materials and I completely come to  the dark digital side.  That year I studied myself some new design soft ,tried different website  constructors and prototyping tools. As well my work also moved to the digital sphere. I began to work with the design of advertisements and social networks. </p>

            <div class="timeline-text">
              <p>From the beginning of the year I tried to focus on development in the field of web design, firstly I completed a UX Analytics and design course, secondly I started looking for a permanent job, since freelance didn’t bring very much money. In the end of I ended up in the field of corporate tourism. The main advantage of my work was the fact that I am the only designer turned out to be the main disadvantage. I experienced a relative freedom of action and at the same time a very big responsibility.  However, the experience that I received over several months of work compensates for all the disadvantages at once. </p>

            <div class="timeline-text">
              <p>There are probably no people in the world who are not affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The familiar structure of the world has changed, and people also had to change.  Considering that in addition to working in tourism, I constantly work with a fitness studio And while tourism and the service sector sadly had sunk  in March,  I managed to see and participate in two examples of transforming  business into  online format. </p> 
              <p>And it seems to me that the place of design in business development has become even more significant in our new reality, than it was before.  Perhaps the design is not yet able to save the world but it can help maintain business processes during the crisis, pandemic or maybe even Apocalypse. </p>
